## ⚠️ NEEDS FIXING (Critical)

### 1. **OpenAI API Key Management** 🔑
**Current Issue**: API key is in backend, costs will be on you!
**Solution Needed**:
- Move OpenAI API key to frontend localStorage
- Re-enable OpenAISetupWizard component
- Pass API key from frontend to backend with each request
- Never store or log the API key

### 2. **SQL Execution** 🔴
**Current Issue**: Complex queries with aggregates can't execute
**Solution Needed**:
- Create Supabase RPC function for executing arbitrary SQL
- OR parse and execute aggregates properly
- Handle JOINs and GROUP BY queries

## 🚧 TODO - Frontend Components

### Dashboard Component
- Currently shows placeholder data
- Needs to pull real stats from Supabase
- Add live match ticker
- Show top scorers, recent matches

### Pattern Discovery
- Not implemented yet
- Need anomaly detection algorithms
- Statistical analysis functions
- Trend visualization

### SQL Explorer (Visual Query Builder)
- Basic component exists
- Need drag-and-drop functionality
- Visual JOIN builder
- Schema visualization

### Live Matches
- Currently placeholder
- Need real-time data source
- WebSocket connection for updates

### Matches List
- Basic display exists
- Need filtering and search
- Pagination
- Match details modal

### Season Stats
- Aggregate statistics display
- League table
- Form guide
- Performance trends

### Top Scorers
- Query exists in backend
- Need proper display component
- Player images
- Goal/assist breakdown

### Player Profile
- Not implemented
- Need player search
- Performance history
- Stats visualization

### AI Assistant
- Chat interface exists
- Need to connect to backend
- Query history
- Contextual suggestions

## 📁 Files to Clean Up/Remove

### Can Remove:
- `/src/services/api/footballData.ts` - Deprecated, using RAG backend
- `/src/services/api/footballData.test.ts` - Test for deprecated service
- Old migration files in `/supabase/migrations/`
- `/src/devdocs/` - Old documentation

### Need Updates:
- `/src/services/dataService.ts` - Update to use real Supabase queries
- `/src/lib/rag/queryGenerator.ts` - Move logic to backend
- `/src/lib/rag/schemaEmbeddings.ts` - Move to backend

## 🎯 Priority Action Items

### URGENT (Do First):
1. **Fix OpenAI API Key**:
   ```typescript
   // In QueryBuilder.svelte
   const apiKey = localStorage.getItem('openai_api_key');
   const response = await ragService.processQuery({
     question: naturalQuery,
     api_key: apiKey, // Pass with each request
     season: selectedSeason
   });
   ```

2. **Create SQL Execution RPC**:
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION execute_sql(query_text TEXT)
   RETURNS JSON AS $$
   DECLARE
     result JSON;
   BEGIN
     EXECUTE 'SELECT json_agg(row) FROM (' || query_text || ') row' INTO result;
     RETURN result;
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
   ```

### HIGH Priority:
3. Connect Dashboard to real data
4. Implement at least one pattern discovery feature
5. Fix Top Scorers display
6. Clean up unused files

### MEDIUM Priority:
7. Visual Query Builder enhancements
8. Player Profile implementation
9. Season Stats aggregations
10. Match filtering and search

### LOW Priority:
11. Live matches (need external data feed)
12. Advanced visualizations
13. Query optimization suggestions
14. Export functionality

## 📊 Completion Status by Phase

| Phase | Status | Completion |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Core RAG System | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Football Intelligence | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Query Optimization | ⚠️ Partial | 40% |

   - Update backend to accept API key in request
   - Store in localStorage only

2. **Fix SQL Execution** (1 hour)
   - Create Supabase RPC function
   - Update executeSQL function
   - Test with complex queries

3. **Connect Dashboard** (1 hour)
   - Pull real match data
   - Show actual top scorers
   - Display recent results

4. **Clean Up Project** (30 mins)
   - Remove deprecated files
   - Update imports
   - Remove unused components

5. **Implement One Showcase Feature** (2 hours)
   - Pattern Discovery OR
   - Visual Query Builder OR
   - Advanced Player Stats

## 💡 Quick Wins

These can be done quickly for immediate impact:

1. **Top Scorers Page** - Query already works, just need display
2. **Recent Matches** - Simple table with results
3. **Team Stats** - Aggregate queries are ready
4. **Query Templates** - Pre-built queries users can run
5. **Help Documentation** - Explain how to use the system

## 🎮 Demo Scenarios Ready

✅ Natural language to SQL conversion
✅ Football terminology understanding
✅ Multi-season queries
✅ Copy SQL functionality
⚠️ Complex aggregations (needs execution fix)
🔴 Pattern discovery
🔴 Visual query builder
🔴 Performance optimization

**Time Remaining**: ~18 hours until deadline
**Critical Path**: API Key → SQL Execution → Dashboard → Clean Up → Deploy

**Recommendation**: Focus on making Query Builder fully functional with user's own API key, then polish existing features rather than adding new ones.
